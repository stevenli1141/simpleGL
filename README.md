# simpleGL

This is intended to be a simple minimal dependency package for doing things with OpenGL. Right now the options for anyone trying to use GL for any purpose might run into the issue of either having to learn it from scratch or having to rely on a massive engine like Unity or UE to programmatically do anything in 3D, where you have to also use a highly opinionated API.

The motivation here is to provide a graphics library that you can easily work with programmatically while also providing support for a minimalist pipeline from a visual 3D asset editor like blender straight to code. You can use this for some simple visualization or you can also use this as a game engine, the flexibility is there.

Includes
* Python script for exporting from blender into C code
* Support for some shader features like lightmaps
* Bloom post-processing

There are some example programs and example assets provided. Many features are planned or in progress e.g. instanced drawing.
